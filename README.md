# Advent of Code Solutions

Here I will be sharing my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) online puzzle.

The solutions might be implemented in different languages, out of curiosity, for practice, comparison or fun.

I tend to mostly focus on Functional Programming style.\
My goal isn't to solve each puzzle as fast as possible. I want to create a beautiful solutions that satisfies me.
 The speed and performance of how fast a solution runs is also not my priority. I try to keep general performance in mind but I don't want to optimize the code for every bit of performance.

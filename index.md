# My AoC solutions

These are [my](https://alavi.me) solutions the Advent of code game.\
I enjoy solving the puzzles in my free time (if I get any).

I might solve a puzzle with different tools and languages just for fun or comparison. Currently, most of the solutions are implemented with functional programming and in Clojure.

I gather the solutions as a notebook with [Clerk notebooks](https://clerk.vision) and this is the first page.

You can just explore the source code, or view it as a notebook with clerk, so you get cleaner interface and visualizations (recommended).

[narimiran](https://github.com/narimiran/aoc2024) inspired me for creating this notebook.

There are some utility functions that make redundant tasks in simpler. They are located at `src/aoc/util`

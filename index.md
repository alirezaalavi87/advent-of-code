# My AoC solutions

These are [my](https://alavi.me) solutions the Advent of code game.\
I enjoy solving the puzzles in my free time (if I get any).

I might solve a puzzle with different tools and languages just for fun or comparison. Currently, most of the solutions are implemented with functional programming and in Clojure.

I gather the solutions as a notebook with [Clerk notebooks](https://clerk.vision) and this is the first page.

You can just explore the source code, or view it as a notebook with clerk, so you get cleaner interface and visualizations (recommended).

[narimiran](https://github.com/narimiran/aoc2024) inspired me for creating this notebook.

There are some utility functions that make redundant tasks in simpler. They are located at `src/aoc/util`

## AoC 2024

2024 wasn't done with clerk notebook. I was just learning Clojure and functional programming and was trying my best to understand and see the benefits of functional programming.

In some puzzles, I wrote with the default style of JS that I was used to (A bit functional but more procedural) and then tried to make it as functional as possible. The comparison between "normal" JS, FP style JS and Clojure are interesting.

;; The goal of the input is to multiply numbers with this exact syntax: `mul(number, number)`
;; But since it is corrupted, there are other characters and invalid `mul` instructions.
;; Extract the correct `mul` instructions, from the text, do the multiplications, and add them all up.

;; Execute mul() instructions from beginning up to a don't() instruction. enable execution again after a do() instruction

;;
;; Method:
;;- Add the implicit do() instruction to the beginning of the input
;;- split input by `don't()` instructions -> at the end of every split there will be a don't() instruction
;;- split each dont-split by do() and remove the first split -> the dont'() up to do() part is deleted and only do() parts remain
;;- calculate the remaining like part1
